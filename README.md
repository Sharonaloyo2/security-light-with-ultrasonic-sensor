Circuit Diagram
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino:

VCC to 5V
GND to GND
Trig to digital pin 9
Echo to digital pin 10
Connect the LED to the Arduino through a 220立 resistor:

LED's positive leg to digital pin 6
Negative leg to the resistor, then to GND
Connect the buzzer to the Arduino:

Positive terminal to digital pin 5
Negative terminal to GND (if using a passive buzzer, connect it in series with a 1k立 resistor)
